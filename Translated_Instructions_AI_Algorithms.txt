Task Instructions for AI Algorithms

1. Overview
This document defines the submission format for assignments in the AI Algorithms course. The output of your program must exactly match the specifications in this document. A submission that deviates from the format, even slightly (e.g., rounding or spacing), will be automatically disqualified.

2. Input Format
The input is provided through a file called input.txt and contains several lines:
- The first line contains the name of the Bayesian network file in XML format (e.g., alarm_net.xml).
- Each subsequent line contains a single query in one of the following formats:
  - P(Q=v | E1=v1, E2=v2,...), algorithm_number
  - P(V1=v1, V2=v2, ...)

Examples:
alarm_net.xml
P(B=F,E=T,A=T,M=T,J=F)
P(B=T|J=T,M=T),1
P(B=T|J=T,M=T),2
P(B=T|J=T,M=T),3
P(J=T|B=T),1
P(J=T|B=T),2
P(J=T|B=T),3

Notes:
- All variables and values must appear in the same format as in the XML file.
- There may be no white spaces around the comma between the query and the algorithm number.

3. Output Format
The program should produce an output file named output.txt. Each line in this file corresponds to the result of the query in the same order as in input.txt.

Each line should include:
<probability>,<number of additions>,<number of multiplications>

Where:
- The probability is rounded and displayed with exactly 5 digits after the decimal point.
- Addition operations count only the additions needed to normalize the results.
- Multiplication operations count all multiplications performed, excluding those in normalization.

Example line:
0.28112,6,11

Rules:
- Do not add any extra characters, text, or comments.
- Do not write explanations or labels.
- If no operations were needed, write 0.
- Lines must be written exactly as specified.

4. General Rules
- Only submit the required files: Ex1.java, BayesianNetwork.java, and any files you created and used directly in the program.
- Do not submit compiled files or the input/output files.
